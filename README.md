# Project Idea/Inspo

I really wanted to make a keyboard to just gain insights on how electronics like keyboards work. After doing the hackpad, I got inspired to make a full keyboard looking at the keyboards other members made. Welp how hard can it be :smile:

Inspo- https://www.montechpc.com/mkey-tkl

Total time spent: 49h 

# Project Overview

This is an 84 key keyboard with Backlit RGB under each key, A rotary Encoder & the MCU used is the RP2035 Stamp.
